### Hi ðŸ‘‹

:purple_heart: In 1997, I fell in love with **programming** when I started using **Fortran** on *Numerical Analysis* during my **Mathematics** degree (1994-1998). Since then I've been coding! ðŸ˜„

:sweat_smile: I also learned more about computers, programming, networks, databases and the Internet while I was studying **Computer Science and Engineering** (1999-2002).

:bulb: I can help with general software development activities including business analysis, gathering requirements, managing teams, designing the architecture of scalable bespoke and customisable solutions, esp. programming web-based database applications, using agile/scrum development methodologies, delivering so simple and powerful tools that users find automation is fun rather than a worry.

> Liaison, with agile and a tad of perfectionism, is a craft that aims
> to tailor a solution to match the requirements of a client by
> navigating around never-ending feature requests and lack of clarity.
